A simple option to connect a FLYSKY controller to any PC or Mac. It uses RPI Pico's native HID support

For now, only works with PWM (tested with FS-IA6)

Apart from the controller and the receiver, you'll need a Rapberry Pi Pico adn a cable to connect it to your computer. Even the cheapest RP240 board for $2 from Aliexpress will do fine.

<b>Instructions:</b>
<ol>
  <li>Press the on-board button on your controller</li>
